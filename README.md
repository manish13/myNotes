My technical notes 

When I read a book. I write notes, proofs and examples, for my reference later. It can be seen as a brief, but not so brief, replacement of the book. This is mainly for personal consumption, so I have not been careful with the typos and minor errors. If you are really annoyed by the errors in the notes you can report them to manish13.at.gmail.com
